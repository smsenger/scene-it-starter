# Scene It

This app utilizes the OMDB APID, and thus the IMDb database to provide search capability for thousands of movies. The UI allows the user to search via keyword and save movies to a watchlist(stored on a linked separate page). The UI is fully responsive. 


## Search Page and Watchlist Page
The site is comprised of two pages: the search page, which fetches data from the OMDB API and allows the user to add a movie to a watchlist. Please see below for page design.

The second page renders the watchlist and allows the user to remove a movie from the list. Once this action is taken, the movie is no longer included in the data and is not seen by the user.

## Minimum Viable Product
The minimum achievements for this project were to allow a user to search and to view the movies on a watchlist. I have added a feature on the watchlist page to remove a movie from the list. I have also made it impossible to add a movie more than once. I am currently working to change button text for a movie that has been added to signal its addition to the user. I am also working to allow the user to remove movies from the watchlist from the search page.
